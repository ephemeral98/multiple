            The Multiple Network Ambassador Program is structured with multiple tiers to recognize
            and reward contributions. Currently, it consists of two levels: Ambassadors and Senior
            Ambassadors. Each tier comes with its own set of responsibilities and benefits. Everyone
            begins as an Ambassador, with the chance to advance to Senior Ambassador through
            consistent dedication and meaningful impact.
